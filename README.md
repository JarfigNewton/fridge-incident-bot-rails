## Overview

A bot that counts how many days has it been since there's been a fridge incident. It will reset the counter as soon as someone mentions "fridge door left ajar". This might be updated to a regex that looks for the word "fridge" and "ajar" in the same sentence in the future. This project is meant to be a fun side project and anyone is welcomed to look at the bot's implementation since it can be a little tricky to set up.
